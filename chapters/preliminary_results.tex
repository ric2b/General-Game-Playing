To get a better understanding of the GGP platform, a few tests were run, using the application \textit{Kiosk} as a game manager (provided by ggp.org) and a few different game players.
Games on the \textit{Kiosk} application have graphical user interfaces and even allow a user to play directly against a player.
A few test players were also created, mixing and matching different components already provided by ggp.org.

Overall, it was quite useful to get some practical knowledge on the field but performance comparisons proved to be quite laborious (many different games have to be tested for the results to have meaning) and so were avoided since better options already exist, namely the Tiltyard game server.
