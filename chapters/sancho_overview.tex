A more up to date and detailed overview of the Sancho project is given in this chapter

\section{The overall architecture}

Sancho is based on the ggp-base framework.
It spawns many different threads but there are only 3 important types:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 1 HTTP server thread: Responsible for network communication with the game manager.
	\item 1 MCTS structure control thread: Handles all MCTS steps except simulation. It's the only thread that can modify the MCTS graph.
	\item N Playout threads: These threads handle simulations (random playouts).    
\end{itemize}
