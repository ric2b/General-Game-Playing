abstract = {The aim of General Game Playing (GGP) is to create intelligent agents that can automatically learn how to play many different games well without any human intervention, given only a description of the game rules. This forces the agents to be able to learn a strategy without having any domain-speciﬁc knowledge provided by their developers. The most successful GGP agents have so far been based on the traditional approach of using game-tree search augmented with an automatically learned evaluation function for encapsulating the domain-speciﬁc knowledge. In this thesis we describe CADIAPlayer, a GGP agent that instead uses a simulation-based approach to reason about its actions. More speciﬁcally, it uses Monte Carlo rollouts with upper conﬁdence bounds for trees (UCT) as its main search procedure. CADIAPlayerhasalreadyproventheeffectivenessofthissimulation-basedapproach in the context of GGP by winning the Third Annual GGP Competition. We describe its implementation as well as several algorithmic improvements for making the simulations more effective. Empirical data is presented showing that CADIA-Player outperforms na{\"{\i}}ve Monte Carlo by close to 90{\%} winning ratio on average on a wide range of games, including Checkers and Othello. We further investigate the relative importance of UCT’s actionselectionrule,itsmemorymodel,andthevariousenhancementsinachieving this result.},

abstract = {A general game playing system is one that can accept a formal description of a game and play the game effectively without human intervention. Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players do not rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; and, unlike Deep Blue, they are able to play different kinds of games. In order to promote work in this area, the AAAI is sponsoring an open competition at this summer's Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This article is an overview of the technical issues and logistics associated with this summer's competition, as well as the relevance of general game playing to the long range-goals of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {The goal of General Game Playing (GGP) has been to develop computer programs that can perform well across various game types. It is natural for human game players to transfer knowledge from games they already know how to play to other similar games. GGP research attempts to design systems that work well across different game types, including unknown new games. In this review, we present a survey of recent advances (2011 to 2014) in GGP for both traditional games and video games. It is notable that research on GGP has been expanding into modern video games. Monte-Carlo Tree Search and its enhancements have been the most influential techniques in GGP for both research domains. Additionally, international competitions have become important events that promote and increase GGP research. Recently, a video GGP competition was launched. In this survey, we review recent progress in the most challenging research areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) related to universal game playing.},
