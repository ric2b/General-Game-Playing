abstract = {A general game playing program plays games that it has not previously encountered. A game manager program sends the game playing programs a description of a game's rules and objectives in a well-defined game description language. A central challenge in creating effective general game playing programs is that of constructing heuristic evaluation functions from game descriptions. This paper describes a method for constructing evaluation functions that represent exact values of simplified games. The simplified games are abstract models that incorporate the most essential aspects of the original game, namely payoff, control, and termination. Results of applying this method to a sampling of games suggest that heuristic evaluation functions based on our method are both comprehensible and effective.},

abstract = {The aim of General Game Playing (GGP) is to create intelligent agents that can automatically learn how to play many different games well without any human intervention, given only a description of the game rules. This forces the agents to be able to learn a strategy without having any domain-speciﬁc knowledge provided by their developers. The most successful GGP agents have so far been based on the traditional approach of using game-tree search augmented with an automatically learned evaluation function for encapsulating the domain-speciﬁc knowledge. In this thesis we describe CADIAPlayer, a GGP agent that instead uses a simulation-based approach to reason about its actions. More speciﬁcally, it uses Monte Carlo rollouts with upper conﬁdence bounds for trees (UCT) as its main search procedure. CADIAPlayerhasalreadyproventheeffectivenessofthissimulation-basedapproach in the context of GGP by winning the Third Annual GGP Competition. We describe its implementation as well as several algorithmic improvements for making the simulations more effective. Empirical data is presented showing that CADIA-Player outperforms na{\"{\i}}ve Monte Carlo by close to 90{\%} winning ratio on average on a wide range of games, including Checkers and Othello. We further investigate the relative importance of UCT’s actionselectionrule,itsmemorymodel,andthevariousenhancementsinachieving this result.},

abstract = {A general game playing system is one that can accept a formal description of a game and play the game effectively without human intervention. Unlike specialized game players, such as Deep Blue, general game players do not rely on algorithms designed in advance for specific games; and, unlike Deep Blue, they are able to play different kinds of games. In order to promote work in this area, the AAAI is sponsoring an open competition at this summer's Twentieth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This article is an overview of the technical issues and logistics associated with this summer's competition, as well as the relevance of general game playing to the long range-goals of artificial intelligence.},

abstract = {The goal of General Game Playing (GGP) has been to develop computer programs that can perform well across various game types. It is natural for human game players to transfer knowledge from games they already know how to play to other similar games. GGP research attempts to design systems that work well across different game types, including unknown new games. In this review, we present a survey of recent advances (2011 to 2014) in GGP for both traditional games and video games. It is notable that research on GGP has been expanding into modern video games. Monte-Carlo Tree Search and its enhancements have been the most influential techniques in GGP for both research domains. Additionally, international competitions have become important events that promote and increase GGP research. Recently, a video GGP competition was launched. In this survey, we review recent progress in the most challenging research areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) related to universal game playing.},

abstract = {Alpha-Beta pruning is one of the most powerful and fundamental MiniMax search improvements. It was designed for sequential two-player zero-sum perfect information games. In this paper we introduce an Alpha-Beta-like sound pruning method for the more general class of ``stacked matrix games'' that allow for simultaneous moves by both players. This is accomplished by maintaining upper and lower bounds for achievable payoffs in states with simultaneous actions and dominated action pruning based on the feasibility of certain linear programs. Empirical data shows considerable savings in terms of expanded nodes and computation time compared to naive depth-first move computation without pruning.$\backslash$n},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of applying an inference engine, i.e. a mechanism able to derive answers from a knowledge base, to General Game Playing (GGP). Our focus is on the General Game Playing Competition framework proposed by the Stanford Logic Group. This particular embodiment of a multi-game playing uses the Game Description Language (GDL) for representing the knowledge base by means of game rules. The GDL is a variant of Datalog and a subset of Prolog, so there is a strong bond with formal logic languages. We present basic principles of our system which is dedicated to GDL. The motivation is to exceed the performance of Prolog engines applied to GDL, which is currently a common approach. Empirical results show that our solution is indeed faster in 6 out of 7 tested games.},
