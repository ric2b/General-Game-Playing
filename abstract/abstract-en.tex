General Game Playing (GGP) aims to create computer systems capable of playing any game without human assistance, being given only the game rules. Such systems must be highly adaptable and should be capable of high-level tasks such as reasoning, learning or deduction, among others.
Player performance is dictated by how well it handles the following two tasks:
Interpreting (and analyzing) the game rules and deriving a strategy for the given game. 
These tasks depend on three characteristics: How efficiently does the system represent it's knowledge, how deep it's analysis of the rules goes and how fast it can search through the possible moves for the game.

In this work an overview of GGP is given and the state of the art solutions are presented.
